### Application Description
- A mobile app that is simulates a shopping cart and a checkout application.

### Things I did in my code
- Added another page (checkout page). Added logic in checkout page needed if there are items added to the shopping cart.

### Challenges when developing the application
- One challenge I found was the addition of listeners and providers as it was a new concept for me. It was confusing at first but as I tried to ru nthe example that is given from the module, I tried to dissect the code little by little, which made me understand the concepts of listeners and providers.
